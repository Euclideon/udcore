# udCore

Copyright (c) Euclideon Pty Ltd

Licensed under [MIT](./LICENSE.md).

This library is used to provide platform abstration and helper modules to other Euclideon projects.

It was originally part of a much larger internal repository that included a lot of projects. As it was split out, most of the history of this project won't build correctly but was maintained where possible.

## Build Instructions

_Note that this isn't currently working from the script due to the premake submodules that we have yet to publish._

Run create_project.bat (windows) or build.sh (Linux) to create a project/makefile.

Primary development environment is Visual Studio 2015.

## Documentation

_Note that documentation is very thin currently as this was intended for internal developers._

As modules are documented links will appear here:
* [udJSON](./Docs/udJSON.md) - JSON Parser/Exporter with limited XML support
